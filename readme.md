# Shoreline Assessment

Design a data structure to represent a allowing or denying traffic by CIDR block
and port range.  Describe this structure in the comments of your code.

Implement a function that takes a set of your structures and a target cloud
platform and applies these rules to the network environment of that platform. 
Please implement your solution for two of the following platforms: AWS, GCP,
Azure, VMware, or Kubernetes.
